    <string name="recommendation_weakest_op_detail_title">Improving with %1$s</string>
    <string name="recommendation_weakest_op_detail_desc">The best way to get better at %1$s is through focused practice. Try setting up a custom difficulty that only includes this operation. Start with smaller numbers to build confidence and gradually increase them as you improve.</string>
    <string name="recommendation_detail_weakest_addition">Here are a few powerful strategies for Addition:\n\n<b>1. Counting On:</b> For a problem like 8 + 3, start at the bigger number (8) and count up three more: 9, 10, 11.\n\n<b>2. Making Tens:</b> For 7 + 5, think of it as 7 + 3 (to make 10) + 2, which equals 12. This is a key mental math trick!\n\n<b>3. Use Visuals:</b> For younger learners, using blocks, beads, or even drawings to represent the numbers and physically combine them can make the concept much clearer.</string>
    <string name="recommendation_detail_weakest_subtraction">Subtraction can be tricky. Here are a few ways to approach it:\n\n<b>1. Counting Back:</b> For 12 - 4, start at 12 and count back four times: 11, 10, 9, 8.\n\n<b>2. Counting Up:</b> Think of it as \'what do I add to 4 to get 12?\'. Count up from 4 to 12. This often feels easier than counting down.\n\n<b>3. Relate to Addition:</b> Every subtraction problem is a missing number addition problem. 12 - 4 = ? is the same as 4 + ? = 12. This connection is very important!</string>
    <string name="recommendation_detail_weakest_multiplication">Mastering multiplication is about understanding groups:\n\n<b>1. Visualize Groups:</b> For 4 x 3, draw 4 groups with 3 items in each and count the total. This builds a strong conceptual foundation.\n\n<b>2. Repeated Addition:</b> Understand that 4 x 3 is the same as 3 + 3 + 3 + 3.\n\n<b>3. Skip Counting:</b> Practice counting by 2s, 3s, 4s, etc. This builds fluency and is a stepping stone to memorizing times tables.</string>
    <string name="recommendation_detail_weakest_division">Division is about fair sharing. Here are several powerful methods:\n\n<b>1. Dealing Out (Sharing):</b> For 15 ÷ 3, imagine you have 15 cookies and 3 friends. \'Deal\' one cookie to each friend at a time until they are all gone. Count how many cookies each friend received.\n\n<b>2. Making Groups (Grouping):</b> Start with 15 items and make groups of 3. Count how many groups you can make.\n\n<b>3. Use Multiplication:</b> Think \'What number times 3 equals 15?\'. Knowing multiplication facts makes division much easier and faster!</string>
    <string name="recommendation_range_struggle_title">Stepping Up the Challenge</string>
    <string name="recommendation_range_struggle_desc">You\'re doing well with %1$s problems with numbers up to %2$d, but it gets trickier with numbers above %3$d. Practice in this higher range will build confidence!</string>
    <string name="recommendation_range_struggle_detail_title">Mastering Larger Numbers</string>
    <string name="recommendation_detail_addition_large">Adding larger numbers, especially those that require \'carrying over\', can be tough. For a problem like 48 + 35:\n\n<b>1. Break It Down (Decomposition):</b> Split the numbers into tens and ones. (40 + 8) + (30 + 5).\n\n<b>2. Add the Tens:</b> 40 + 30 = 70.\n\n<b>3. Add the Ones:</b> 8 + 5 = 13.\n\n<b>4. Combine:</b> 70 + 13 = 83.\n\nThis method avoids carrying and makes the problem much clearer. Practice this with numbers in the challenging range.</string>
    <string name="recommendation_detail_subtraction_large">Subtraction with \'borrowing\' is a common hurdle. For a problem like 72 – 49:\n\n<b>1. Counting Up:</b> Start at 49. How much to get to 50? (1). How much from 50 to 70? (20). How much from 70 to 72? (2). Now add the jumps: 1 + 20 + 2 = 23.\n\n<b>2. Break Apart:</b> Change 72 to 60 + 12. Then, 60 - 40 = 20, and 12 - 9 = 3. Finally, 20 + 3 = 23.\n\nThis avoids the confusion of borrowing and builds stronger number sense.</string>
    <string name="recommendation_detail_multiplication_large">Multiplying bigger numbers seems hard, but breaking them down makes it simple. For 14 x 6:\n\n<b>1. Split the bigger number:</b> 14 is the same as 10 + 4.\n\n<b>2. Distribute:</b> The problem becomes (10 x 6) + (4 x 6).\n\n<b>3. Solve the easy parts:</b> 10 x 6 = 60. And 4 x 6 = 24.\n\n<b>4. Add them up:</b> 60 + 24 = 84.\n\nThis \'distributive method\' is a key strategy for mental multiplication.</string>
    <string name="recommendation_detail_division_large">For division like 84 ÷ 4, we can also break the big number apart:\n\n<b>1. Find Friendly Numbers:</b> Think of 84 as 80 + 4. Both 80 and 4 are easy to divide by 4.\n\n<b>2. Divide Each Part:</b> 80 ÷ 4 = 20. And 4 ÷ 4 = 1.\n\n<b>3. Add the Results:</b> 20 + 1 = 21.\n\nThis works great when the larger number can be split into easy multiples of the divisor. It\'s a powerful mental math technique!</string>
